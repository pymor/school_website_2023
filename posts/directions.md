The School takes place at the PC-Pool in room VWS 128. It is located on a small island between canals. The island has a very prominent blue building with large pink tubes, the so-called [Rosa Röhre](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_R%C3%B6hre). One can only enter the VWS building via the *blue bridge* from Müller-Breslau Straße on the south side. [Click here](../../venue) for detailed directions.
